        <h2>Accounts for EA-BANK-WEALTH Customers</h2>
        <p>
            Banks stand to earn more off of their relationships with EA-BANK-WEALTH clients, so they’re eager to reward you and compete for your business. As you shop for private banks and other companies you feel could meet your needs, compare these features. Higher
            APY: With a significant savings account balance, you should be eligible to earn more—a higher annual percentage yield on your deposits. Evaluate how much banks pay at different levels, and shop around. But you may find that, even as a millionaire,
            online banks are the best place for idle cash.1 Dedicated Customer Service: Most financial institutions have specialized departments for customers, and it pays to work with those teams. You get access to experienced individuals who have excellent
            customer service skills and who are more empowered to solve problems for high-priority clients.2 Free Services: Although you can afford to pay $35 for a wire transfer, it’s nice to get things for free. With a sizable account balance, you should
            automatically enjoy no monthly fees, free cashier’s checks, free stop payment requests, a safety deposit box, and more. ATM rebates are more or less standard for customers.3 Higher Payment Limits: Standard bank rules may be inconvenient for
            millionaire customers, who often need to move large sums. But private banking arrangements typically allow for much larger debit card purchases, higher ATM withdrawal limits, and generous ACH transfers.4 Better Borrowing: Look for lower interest
            rates on loans, but don’t expect free money. Still, banks are willing to waive origination fees and other closing costs, as well as move your application through underwriting quickly.5 They might even make exceptions when you don’t fit the
            standard profile. Cash Management Accounts: Some firms that traditionally served brokerage needs now want your banking business. Cash management accounts, with competitive interest rates and ATM rebates, are ideal for millionaires who prefer
            to manage their finances themselves. Plus, cash management accounts can spread funds among multiple banks to provide more than $250,000 of FDIC insurance in a single account. For example, the Fidelity Cash Management account uses bank partnerships
            to place up to $1,250,000 in EA-BANK-WEALTH-insured accounts.
